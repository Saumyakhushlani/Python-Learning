# To get the address of a variable
num = 5
id(num)

a=4
b=5
b=a
#If we find the id of a and b the both will be the same 
# In Python if for two variables have same value than their addresses will be same
# Means both will point to the same box

# whenever the data is not used by any tag or value in python then it is stored in garbage collection

# To love the type of variable in python we use type
